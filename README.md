# PEWLETT-HACKARD ANALYSIS
------------------
## OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS

This analysis was based on SQL queries to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program in Pewlett Hackard.

## RESULTS 

After retrieving the employee table from the company's database, we found 300,024 records from 1985-01-01. The same number of employee numbers exist as well, so in total, we can conclude there has been 300,024 employees at Pewlett Hackard.

Using SQL we have identified the next quantity of employees by departments:

Based on the database, Development (26%), Production (22%) and Sales (16%) represent 2/3 of the total employees of PH.

The queried data also let us define the employee's distribution per gender, as shown in the next image:

PH has achieved a high participation in the labor force for women. The Silver Tsunami challenge could be a great opportunity to level up this participation, based on the significant percentage of new hiring to be needed in the next few months.

>One of the main reasons of this data analysis is to quantify how many new employees/hirings will be needed in the coming months per department and title. All this 
>data will be an important tool for the Human Resource department to plan an adequate hiring process program, that ensures enough qualified employees, to substitute the >
>Silver Tsunami and the natural growing need of staff, to support the succesful growth of the company.

The data queries executed have detemined that three titles/positions will the biggest impact from the Silver Tsunami. These positions represent 79% of the future retirees, as can be noted in the next graph.
